        <h2 class="centered-title">About Rachel</h2>
        <p>My background is in <a class="about-links" href="pwArch.html" target="_blank" >architecture</a>—I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo right after the great recession of 2008 and was lucky to have landed an internship in Los Angeles.  Six years later, I am proud to have worked alongside talented project teams on the Naval Hospital at Camp Pendleton and the U.S. Bank (Vikings) Stadium in Minneapolis. </p>

          <h5>WHY ARE YOU A DESIGNER?</h5>
        </div>
        <h3>Growing up, I was mesmerized by the beauty and precision of systems.</h3>
        <p>More specifically, the way repetitive kits-of-parts can be combined in endless permutations to create different structures that serve specific purposes.</p>
        <div class="img-contain1">
          <img class="img-incontain1" src="assets/about/1x/about4.png" />
        </div>
        <p>My brother told me that when we were kids, he distinctly remembered me pushing away Barbie dolls and reaching for the boxes of Lego’s. </p>
        <p>My parents saw that I had an aptitude for building things and encouraged it. While most dads would buy their little daughters easy-bake ovens and stuffed animals, my dad bought me the lego set of a medieval fortress, complete with a drawbridge.</p>
        <p>It came with the most beautiful construction manual I have ever seen: an exploded axonometric drawing of the castle where I could see how every single lego component combine to form the superstructure. It was perfectly rendered with the appropriate line weights to communicate depth and hierarchy  to six-year-old me.</p>
        <div class="page-separator"></div>
        <h3 class="pullquotes">Ultimately, it was this fascination with beauty and utility that led me to choose architecture in college.</h3>
        <!-- section2 -->
        <div class="section-separator">
          <h5>WHAT MADE YOU SWITCH?</h5>
        </div>
        <p>Architecture taught me that the design of physical environments can influence human behaviors. I marveled at the way people’s behaviors change with respect to their environments. Like the way people tend to gather for formal occasions in light-filled spaces with high ceilings, and the way friends tend to host small gatherings in nooks and how the dimmed lighting somehow adds to the sense of closeness between them.</p>
        <div class="img-contain1">
          <img class="img-incontain1" src="assets/about/1x/about5.png" />
        </div>
        <p>This focus on designing spaces for human-interactions kept me going in architecture school, but it gradually disappeared the longer I stayed in the field. Although I was trained to design buildings, what excites me is having a voice in shaping people’s experiences in a personal and relational way. Seeing that people connect with and respond emotionally to my creations was important to me.</p>
        <div class="page-separator"></div>
        <h3 class="pullquotes">In order to impact people at an emotional and relational level, I needed to shift from designing the <span>tectonics</span> of <span>static</span> building systems—to designing the <span>behavior</span> of <span>responsive</span> digital systems.</h3>
        <p>So after six years, I stepped away from architecture to study human perception. Cognitive psychology particularly resonated with me. I became convinced that in order to become a great designer, one must first understand and design for the limits of human cognition. </p>
        <p>It turns out I never really stopped building. I consider the discipline of User Experience as another form of building where I construct (digital) environments that encourage quality interactions.</p>
        <div class="page-separator"></div>
        <h3 class="pullquotes">User Experience Design is where the analytical nature of my architectural background and my empathetic approach to designing system behaviors coalesce.</h3>
        <!-- section3 -->
        <div class="section-separator">
          <h5>WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO WORK ON?</h5>
        </div>
        <p>My dream is to build a better world by designing systems that enable people to live more meaningful lives and remind them of the inherent dignity they posses.  As a third culture kid, I was no stranger to being excluded. I know what it's like not to be given a seat at the table and to be bullied into believing that your voice does not matter.</p>
        <div class="page-separator"></div>
        <h3 class="pullquotes">Designing experiences that empower underserved and  marginalized user groups is close to my heart.</h3>
        <p>I am currently working on a diabetic life-management app for kids to help them make better food choices, stay tuned for that case-study!</p>

          <h5>WHO ARE YOU OUTSIDE OF WORK?</h5>
        </div>
        <p>I still build things. I sketched, prototyped, and constructed  a line of table <a href="pwFurn.html" class="about-links" target="_blank">furniture</a> inspired by architectural hardware pieces and other objects of industry. Also, the beauty of flowers calm my soul. On the weekends, you can find me taking photos at the Huntington Rose Garden or visiting the Los Angeles flower market. To put my <a href="pwFloristry.html" class="about-links" target="_blank" >floral design</a> skills to good use, I arranged bridal bouquets for friends and took orders for mother’s day floral arrangements.</p>
